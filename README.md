# New Spectrum Modules

This page is being edited off-site and will be available (to a limited extent, at least) shortly.

Thank you for your patience unlikely random stranger who stumbled upon my repo, we hope to see you again soon. ❤️

<!-- Begin Page Content -->

Welcome to the official site for New Spectrum's PowerShell Module Packages, hosted by GitHub Page. Because GitHub Pages builds sites out of the actual Repos/Projects they are connected to (for more information, see the [GitHub Pages](https://pages github.com)), this site will include all of the amazing content on the GitHub Repo, but *fancier* (and eventually, with added ✨magical✨ features).

## Currently *Very* Under Construction

This site, and the repo itself, are fresh out of the oven, so pretty much everything is still cooling off (under construction). Content will be made available as it's developed, for the time being. __This means...__

### What to Expect:

- Pretty much *all* files will be:
	- Basically empty, most likely containing totally random, ridiculous/nonsensical content as placeholder text I added for my own amusement.
		- If compared to the birth of a child, this repo is still being slapped by the doctor. So this will be the most prominent status of files at this point in the development process,
	- Incomplete or barely started
	- Empty template documents
- You can expect just about everything to be broken.
	- Also, if anything works, expect it to break (at least for an hour or so) at any given moment.


### Also Under Construction...

This repository for __*New Spectrum Modules*__ isn't the only thing still be spanked upside down. The entirety of __New Spectrum Academy__ is also brand spankin' new (I'm sorry, I couldn't resist that pun). So, in addition to any repositories under the `newspectrumacademy.com` domain, the entire site of `https://newspectrumacademy.com` is is both live and under the same set of "expect the worst" conditions as the repositories under it.

Some of you are probably confused and/or amused by my approach to the development process of the Academy's *actual* business website- because it is just that (and you can learn more about said business on said chaotic mess of a website). There is a method to the madness, though, and the details of my madness will be provided soon on the *About The Academy* Page... once it exists.

Believe it or not, even though I've been in IT for 20ish years, my first *career* was in Graphics/Branding, Marketing, & Advertising- skills and subjects that I also plan to add to the Academy's programs. So the madness to which I have a method isn't as mad as you might think.

### By the way, my name is Richard

Let me also take a moment to introduce myselt so you have at a *vague* idea of who's running this circus and, more importantly, why I started it in the first place.

As I mentioned above, I __long__ history in the field of Information Technology. I also have a significant amount of experience in a wide variety of other fields, include (but not limited to):

- Digital Graphics<br >(mentioned above)
- Marketing/Advertising<br >(mentioned above)
- Business Management
- Photography
- Photo Editing
	- Advanced Photo Manipulation
- Video Production
- Event Planning & Management
- Live Entertainment Production

You could say I have a knack for picking up new skills. I am extremely fortunate to be able to learn these new skills very, __*very*__ quickly. This is thanks to a wonderfully bittersweet quality of my autistically-enhanced ADHD called __"Hyperfixation"__ (co-sponsored by *prescription meth*). The best part? The most efficient way for *me* to learn something is by teaching it.

I will also be providing more information about myself (background, skills, experience, qualifications, favorite flavor of pie, etc) as soon I'm able, which will also be made available on the main site.
